// Here's a question based on using a common friend function to
//  swap private data of two different classes in C++:
// Question:
// You are developing a program to model a student and
//  teacher information system. Define two classes, Student and Teacher, 
//  where each class has private attributes such as name and age.
// Implement a common friend function named swapData outside both 
// classes that takes objects of both Student and Teacher as parameters
//  and swaps their private data (name and age). Ensure that the friend 
//  function can access the private members of both classes.
// Additionally, include methods in both the Student and Teacher
//  classes to display their respective information (displayStudentInfo for
//   Student and displayTeacherInfo for Teacher).
// Write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of the common friend 
// function to swap private data and the methods to display student and teacher information.
//  Create instances of the Student and Teacher classes, swap their data, and 
//  then display the updated information.
// Please provide the C++ code to implement this scenario.
